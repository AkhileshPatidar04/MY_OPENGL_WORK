# OpenGL Learning for Rubik's Cube Solver and Chess GUI

This repository documents my journey of learning **OpenGL** with the goal of building a **3D GUI for a Rubik's Cube Solver**.

I am currently learning from [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) â€” one of the best resources for understanding modern OpenGL. Through this, I aim to:

- Understand how 3D graphics work from scratch  
- Implement a clean, interactive Rubik's Cube interface using OpenGL  
- Explore real-time rendering, camera movement, shaders, and user input  
- Apply mathematical concepts like rotation, transformation, and projection in a visual way

This repo may include:
- Practice code from LearnOpenGL tutorials  
- Experiments and prototypes for parts of the Rubikâ€™s Cube solver  
- Clean, commented code and documentation as I progress

### ðŸš§ This project is a work in progress

I'm sharing my code as I learn â€” feedback, suggestions, and collaborations are always welcome!
